# Microprocessor FinalProject
- Final project of Microprocessor
- Spring 2023
- Instructed by Dr. Dara Rahmati 

## Description
In this project, we're going to implement a *Signal Generator* tool using *STM32F401* microcontroller.
The system includes two modules:
- One module will be a user interface (UI).
- The other one is going to generate waveforms.

These two modules will communicating using *SPI* protocol. In picture below, we see the *Block Diagram* of this system.

![System Block Diagram](https://github.com/Aminho09/Microprocessor_FinalProject/blob/main/images/System%20Block%20Diagram.png "System Block Diagram")

In this tool, we create **Sine**, **Square**, **Tringle**, **Abstract Sine**, **Step**, and **Sawtooth** waveform. The user can define output frequency and the duration of displaying the wave on the output.

## User Interface (UI) Unit

## Waveform Generator Unit

I'll wrote these someday :)
