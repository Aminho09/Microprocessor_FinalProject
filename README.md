# Microprocessor FinalProject
- Final project of Microprocessor
- Spring 2023
- Instructed by Dr. Dara Rahmati 

## Description
In this project, we're going to implement a *Signal Generator* using *STM32F401* microcontroller.
The system includes two modules:
- One module will be a user interface (UI).
- The other one is going to generate waveforms.
- 
These two modules will communicating using *SPI* protocol.
